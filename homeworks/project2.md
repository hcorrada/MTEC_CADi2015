In this project you will work on your regression 
abilities.


### Regression Analysis

In this part of this project you will practice and experiment with linear regression using
data from [gapminder.org](http://gapminder.org). I recommend spending a little time looking at material there, it is quite an informative site. 

We will use a subset of data provided by gapminder provided by [Jennifer Bryan](http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/) described in it's [github page](https://github.com/jennybc/gapminder).

I have included this package into the class Docker image. You should get it once you restart the class Docker image. [More info here](http://cbcb.umd.edu/~hcorrada/IntroDataSci/resources.html)

Please [download this R markdown file](gapminder.Rmd), and complete as
required. Knit into a pdf (or html) file and submit as directed below.

### Handing in

Please submit knitted file `gapminder.pdf` to ELMS
