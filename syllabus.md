##CADi: Introduction to Data Science with R

This page and the [main course page](index.html) serve as syllabus for this class.

##Introduction

Data science encapsulates the interdisciplinary activities required to
 create data-centric products and applications that address specific
 scientific, socio-political or business questions.
 It has drawn tremendous attention from both academia and industry and
 is making deep inroads in industry, government, health and journalism.

This course focuses on (i) exploratory and statistical data analysis,
(ii) data and information visualization, and (iii) the presentation
and communication of analysis results.
It will be centered around case studies and projects drawing extensively from applications.

##Course Information

	Additional readings will be posted in the [course calendar](calendar.html).

####Expected outcomes

1) Students will be able to create specific requirements for a
data-centric application used to address a specific problem or
question  
2) Students will be able to identify and select appropriate tools:
language, libraries and data resources, to meet specific requirements
for a data-centric application  
3) Students will be able to build and disseminate a data-centric
application from a set of specific requirements using existing tools,
libraries, data resources and publishing mechanisms.
