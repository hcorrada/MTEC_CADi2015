Suppose you are given a dataset $\mathbf{X}=\{\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_n\}$, where $\mathbf{x}_i$ is the vector
of $p$ predictor values for the $i$-th observation.

I just ran the Principal Components Algorithm to obtain linear transformations

$$
\left[ \phi_1, \phi_2, \ldots \phi_p \right]
$$

And have calculated matrix

$$
Z_{n\times 2} = X_{n \times p} \left[ \phi_1, \phi_2 \right]_{p \times 2}
$$

and now want to analyze the results: i.e., vectors $\phi_j$ and matrix $Z$.

1) What is the length of each vector $\phi_j$?

2) What would I include in a scatter plot showing how observations are embedded in the two-dimensional space defined by the first two principal components of $\mathbf{X}$?

3) What would I include in a scatter plot showing how predictors are correlated based on the first two principal components of $\mathbf{X}$.

4) In principal components analysis, should I always scale the columns of $\mathbf{X}$ to have equal variance? Why?
